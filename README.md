SOLID Principles Demonstrated in Code

This project is a practical demonstration of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design, including the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). The project features multiple examples of how to apply each principle to write clean, maintainable, and extensible code.

This repository provides code samples, explanations, and practical implementations to help developers understand and apply SOLID principles in their software design and development process.
